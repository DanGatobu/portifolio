**Last Updated:** February 4, 2026

## Overview

Privacy URL Scanner ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

The App operates entirely on your device and:
- Does NOT send your URLs to any external servers
- Does NOT track your usage
- Does NOT collect analytics
- Does NOT require an account or login
- Does NOT access your contacts, location, or other personal information

- **App Preferences**: Your onboarding completion status

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Can be cleared at any time through the app's history feature

## Permissions

When you expand a shortened URL, your device makes a direct connection to that URL shortener service (e.g., bit.ly). We do not control or have access to this connection.
